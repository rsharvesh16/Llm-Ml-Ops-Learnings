## Welcome to My Journey in LLM, ML, and MLOps

Hello! I'm thrilled to have you here as I embark on my learning adventure into the world of Large Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning (ML), and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). This repository will serve as a hub for all the resources, notes, and projects that I gather and create along the way.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning process in the fields of LLM, ML, and MLOps. I will be sharing valuable resources, tutorials, and projects that I find or develop. My goal is to create a comprehensive guide that can be useful for anyone looking to explore these exciting fields.

## LangChain Resources

LangChain is a powerful tool for developing applications that integrate language models with various other data sources and environments. Here are some resources I've found useful:

- [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/)
- [LangChain GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
- [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/getting_started/tutorials/)

## Large Language Models (LLM)

### Open-Source LLM

Open-source large language models provide an excellent way to experiment and build without the constraints of proprietary software. Here are some notable ones:

- [GPT-3 by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3)
- [BERT by Google](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
- [T5 by Google](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer)
- [GPT-Neo by EleutherAI](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo)

### Paid LLM

While open-source models are great, paid models often come with additional support and enhanced capabilities. Here are some popular paid LLM services:

- [OpenAI GPT-4](https://www.openai.com/gpt-4)
- [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai)
- [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/)
- [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson)

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is the backbone of modern artificial intelligence. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Coursera Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
- [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

## Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

MLOps is essential for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production. Here are some resources and tools:

- [MLOps Guide by Google](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning)
- [MLflow by Databricks](https://mlflow.org/)
- [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/)
- [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/)

## Projects

Here, I will be documenting my projects as I apply what I've learned. Stay tuned for more updates!

- [Project 1: Deploying a Model with Kubeflow](projects/deploying-with-kubeflow.md)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all the creators of the resources I've listed here. Their work has been invaluable in my learning journey.
